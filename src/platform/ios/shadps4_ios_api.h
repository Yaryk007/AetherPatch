// Plain C ABI for embedding shadps4 into a host app process (the standalone AetherPS4
// iOS app; potentially other Swift hosts later) instead of running it as the `shadps4`
// CLI executable. Built as the `shadps4_ios` CMake target (SHADPS4_LIBRARY_BUILD),
// which compiles the same emulator/core sources as the CLI target with src/main.cpp's
// CLI/process-lifetime responsibilities replaced by these entry points; see
// src/platform/ios/shadps4_ios_api.cpp for what each call actually does.
//
// The standalone app lets SDL3 own the window and its own input/event handling (see
// PORTING plan, Phase 1 context) exactly as it already does on the desktop build, so
// there is no separate input API here for v1 -- gamepad/touch input flows through SDL's
// normal event pump once shadps4_run() creates the window.

// this call (matching the desktop build's Frontend::WindowSDL usage), and Apple's
// windowing frameworks require that on the main thread -- calling this from a
// background thread fails during SDL video subsystem init. Returns 0 on a normal exit.
//
// Implemented as shadps4_prepare_window() + shadps4_run_loop() back-to-back on the

// The split version of shadps4_run(), for a host that wants its own main thread free for
// normal UI work (SwiftUI, Timers, etc.) for the whole game session instead of just until
// the window exists. shadps4_prepare_window() does the same UIKit-touching setup
// shadps4_run() used to block the WHOLE session for, but returns as soon as the window is
// created -- still MUST be called from the app's main thread, same reason as shadps4_run()
// above. Returns 0 on success; on failure no window was created and shadps4_run_loop()
// must not be called.
int shadps4_prepare_window(const char* eboot_path);

// Same as shadps4_prepare_window(), but also passes guest argv entries through to the new
// game's entry point -- args_joined_by_newline is a single string with each argument
// separated by '\n' (an empty string means no args, same as calling shadps4_prepare_window()
// directly). Needed for resuming after a restart request (see shadps4_take_pending_restart()
// below): sceSystemServiceLoadExec's caller supplies its own argv, and on real hardware
// those are what tell the newly-loaded image to resume mid-story instead of booting cold --
// discarding them was confirmed on-device to drop the player back at the game's main menu
// instead of continuing.
int shadps4_prepare_window_with_args(const char* eboot_path, const char* args_joined_by_newline);

// Runs the actual game session (starts guest execution, then blocks in SDL's event loop
// until the game exits or shadps4_stop() is called) -- everything shadps4_prepare_window()
// didn't already do. Safe to call from a background thread: by this point the window and
// every other UIKit object involved already exist, SDL's own event queue is thread-safe by
// design (built to support exactly this -- input delivered on the main thread's run loop,
// consumed from another), and nothing left in this call touches UIKit directly. This is
// what actually frees the main thread: call this from a dedicated background thread (not
// DispatchQueue.global(), which doesn't guarantee it stays on the same OS thread this
// blocks for the whole session) right after shadps4_prepare_window() succeeds on the main
// thread, and the app's own SwiftUI/UIKit content keeps working normally for the entire
// game session. Returns 0 on a normal exit.
int shadps4_run_loop(void);

// Call once, right after shadps4_run_loop() returns, to distinguish a game requesting an
// in-process restart (sceSystemServiceLoadExec -- e.g. a chapter/level transition) from a
// normal exit. iOS can't fork()/exec() a new process the way every other platform's
// Emulator::Restart() does (see its own comment); instead the new eboot path/args are handed
// back here for the host to relaunch with, the same way it launched the first game, rather
// than the whole app quick_exit()-ing the way an unhandled fork() failure otherwise would.
//
// Returns 1 and fills path_buf and args_buf (both NUL-terminated, each truncated to its own
// buf_size if needed) if a restart was requested; returns 0 (both buffers untouched)
// otherwise -- a normal exit. args_buf receives the guest's argv entries joined by '\n' (see
// shadps4_prepare_window_with_args()'s own comment for the encoding and why these matter);
// pass args_buf_size 0 (with args_buf possibly nullptr) to skip retrieving them if a caller
// only cares about the path.

// to dismiss itself in favor of actual game video, rather than guessing with a timeout.

// any thread.

// Registers a callback invoked exactly once, synchronously, the instant the Vulkan
// presenter completes its first real swapchain present -- on the presenter's own render
// thread, NOT necessarily the thread that registered it and NOT necessarily the main
// thread, so a Swift/UIKit host must still hop to the main thread itself before touching
// any UI from inside the callback. Pushed rather than polled: a host UI's boot loading
// screen can dismiss itself the moment this fires instead of sampling
// shadps4_has_presented_frame() on a timer. Must be called before shadps4_run(). Passing
// nullptr clears any previously registered callback.

// Probes whether the JIT-granting protocol actually works right now: allocates a

// releases it. That allocation only succeeds if an external debugger (StikDebug) is
// attached AND is actively running the JIT script to service the BRK-trap handshake --
// unlike just checking whether *some* debugger is attached, this exercises the real
// end-to-end path the emulator itself depends on for JIT memory. Independent of
// shadps4_init()/shadps4_run() -- safe (and intended) to call before either, e.g. from
// a host UI's one-time setup check at launch. Returns non-zero on success.
//
// CALLER MUST confirm a debugger is actually attached (e.g. Swift's checkDebugged(),
// which only inspects the process's own codesign/csops state and never touches the
// BRK path) before calling this. The BRK instruction this triggers is unconditional --
// with no debugger attached to service it, it raises a raw, unhandled SIGTRAP that
// terminates the process outright, not a graceful failure (confirmed on-device; see
// fex_guest_engine.cpp's "Do NOT detach the debugger here" comment for the same
// failure mode hit via a different call site). Calling this blind, before any
// attachment check, WILL crash the app when StikDebug isn't attached.

// iOS 26: claims a `pool_mb` megabyte execute-capable JIT pool from StikDebug in one request,
// then (if `detach` is non-zero) detaches the debugger so the rest of the session never depends
// on StikDebug staying alive. All later JIT allocations are carved from that pool. Call right
// after StikDebug attaches and before shadps4_init(); same "debugger must be attached" rule as
// shadps4_probe_jit(). Idempotent. Returns non-zero on success.

// on the caller side), or NULL if no game is running. SDL creates this window itself --
// it is a separate UIWindow from whatever hosts the app's own SwiftUI content, not a view
// inside it -- so a host UI that wants native controls visible over gameplay must add them
// as a subview of THIS window (or of its rootViewController's view), not of its own
// window, since a second independent UIWindow was already confirmed on-device not to
// repaint reliably once shadps4_run() takes the main thread's SDL run loop (see
// mobile_overlay.h's header comment for that history). Only meaningful once SDL's window
// actually exists -- call this from a shadps4_register_first_frame_callback() callback (or
